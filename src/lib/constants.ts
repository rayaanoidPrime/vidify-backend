    referenceData: `Wood is a versatile and popular material that is used for many purposes. There are many different types of wood, each with its own distinct features, applications, and benefits. One common type of wood is pine. Pine is a softwood that is light in color and has a straight grain. It is a common choice for construction, as it is relatively inexpensive and easy to work with. Pine is also a popular choice for furniture, particularly in rustic or country-style decor. It can be stained or painted to match any color scheme and can be used to create a variety of different pieces, including bookshelves, tables, and beds.\n\nAnother popular type of wood is oak. Oak is a hardwood that is known for its strength and durability. It has a coarse texture and a distinctive grain pattern that makes it a popular choice for furniture and flooring. Oak is also a popular choice for construction, particularly in areas where high-strength wood is required, such as in bridges or boats. Oak can be stained or finished to highlight its natural beauty, and it is also resistant to moisture, making it a good choice for outdoor furniture or decking.`,
